I get asked often about my work set up and I've seen other people share their tools and gears this way so here's mine:

## Editor & Terminal

#### Editor:

Visual Studio Code is my code editor of choice. Paired with the wonderful night-owl theme by Sarah Drasner, I couldn't ask for more.

#### Terminal:

I have both iTerm2 and hyper and honestly, I love them both. Which one I use really depends on which comes to mind first when I need a terminal. That said, I've been using Fig mostly in the last couple of weeks, I just like the auto completioning capabilities.

## Apps

**1Password** is my password manager of choice. I go introduced to password managers this year, I started off with 1Password and I don't think I'll ever go back to managing my passwords on my own again.

**Calendar**: Google Calendar and Clockwise pairs up really nicely to give me all the things I need. I've heard of fancier calendar tools that I should probably check out some time but I'll stick with those until then.

**Collaboration**: Slack and Discord

**Writing**: MacDown
