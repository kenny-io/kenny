Hello friends, if you're reading this, I have some exciting news to share. Today, I'm happy to announce that I'll be taking on 5 people to mentor and help upscale their careers in DevRel. For the past 5 years, I've been actively working in the DevRel space. As a result, I intend to use the experience and expertise I've gained over the years to help a couple more people take the next step.

I've designed this program specifically for developers who are looking to transition into a career in DevRel. To that effect, we'll be focusing on the following areas:

- ### Developer Experience Engineering

  - ✅ Open source contributions
  - ✅ Demonstrative projects
  - ✅ Code reviews
  - ✅ Communications and feedback
  - ✅ Code reviews
  - ✅ Internal feature development

- ### Community and Education

  - ✅ Community building
  - ✅ Conferences and events
  - ✅ Developer marketing
  - ✅ Content creation
  - ✅ Developer evangelism

- ### Documentation and Technical writing
  - ✅ Documentation
  - ✅ Technical writing
  - ✅ Tones, fluency and clarity
  - ✅ Conversion and happy paths
  - ✅ User experiences, etc.

Seeing that different companies approach Developer Relations in different ways, I thought it best to prepare you in as many areas as I can to better equip you with the knowledge and skill required to charge you into any DevRel role.

Combining the experiences I've gained by working with different companies in different capacities, I'm confident we can create a unique experience that will prepare you for your first DevRel role.

## Extras

- You will learn directly from me, and from yourselves.
- I will introduce you to my network and help you get job ready.
- You'll be part of my process and shadow my work as a DX Engineer.
- We will be friends and I'll hopefully convince you to play Fortnite with me.
- It'll be fun, engaging, and a great learning experience for all of us.

## Are you interested?

If this sounds like a good opportunity to you, I've opened up applications for the first cohort of this program and you can currently [Apply Here](https://uoo376jx6hb.typeform.com/to/zVymBRsP). Selection is not guaranteed, seeing as I'm only looking for 5 people at this time so as not to over burden myself. To increase your chances, please be very intentional about your answers to

1. "Why" you need this mentorship and
2. "How" will you pay it forward

## Future plans

With the experiences and lessons learned from this cohort, I intend to find a way to automate some of the process to allow me take on more people in the next cohorts. In addition, I'll be reaching out to other established advocates who are willing to take on mentees as well. If you're currently in DevRel and would like to join me in this program to mentor more people, please reach out and we'll figure out how to make it work with your schedule. Collectively, we can help more people, and achieve greater results.
