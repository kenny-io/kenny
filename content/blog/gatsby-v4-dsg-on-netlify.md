So Gatsby v4 is out and it came in hot!.

Amongst other features that came with it is a Deferred Static Generation (DSG) rendering mode that offers you a new way to render pages on-demand.

Pages with DSG rendering mode will not be generated at build time, they will be generated at request time, cached and served to users. Subsequent requests for the already generated pages will then be served from the cache.

Does this sound familiar to you? it does to me seeing that this concept is in-line with the [DPR](https://github.com/jamstack/jamstack.org/discussions/549) approach that Netlify announced a couple of months ago.

### So how do I use this DSG thing on Netlify?

Thankfully the wonderful Netlify integrations team already did all the hard work for us so all we need to do is enable support for Gatsby v4 and just keep writing our Gatsby code like before.

Then if we need to specify a particular rendering mode for any of our pages, we just add a tiny line of config:

```js
defer: true;
```

And that page will be statically generated and rendered on-demand.

Also if you're trying to use DSG in your existing Gatsby sites, there's a [migration guide available](https://v4.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/migrating-from-v3-to-v4/) for people using Gatsby v3. You can follow the process to update your existing Gatsby sites.

### Demo time

So I have a news site with 6 news items, all statically generated at build time. What I intend to do now is share the load, I'll generate the first 3 pages **(breaking news)** of my news items at build time with the SSG rendering mode and generate the last 3 pages **(archives)** with DSG at request time.

My reasoning here is that people want to read the breaking news immediately so it makes sense to have ir pre-generated at build time. But the archived new items? hmmm they may not want to read that at all (so let's only generate it when they ask for it).

To do this, I'll first need to update Gatsby and all it's dependencies:

```bash
npm install gatsby@next

```

If you have other Gatsby dependencies and plugins, update all of those as well.

### Enable it on Netlify

With all that done, you have Gatsby v4!. Now let's get it working on Netlify.

There are 3 steps to enable Gastby v4 sites on Netlify:

#### 1. Install the Netlify Gatsby build plugin

From your project's base directory, install the plugin as a devDependency like this:

```bash
npm install -D @netlify/plugin-gatsby@^2.0.0-beta
```

Next, create a `netlify.toml` file in the root of your project and update it with the plugins section below:

```toml
[[plugins]]
package = "@netlify/plugin-gatsby"
```

#### 2. Install Gatsby's Netlify plugin

To use the new features, you must install the beta vbersion of [the gatsby-plugin-netlify package](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-netlify/) into your project like:

```bash
npm install -D gatsby-plugin-netlify@next
```

And then update your `gatsby-config.js` file with the plugin like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ["gatsby-plugin-netlify"]
};
```

#### 3. Set build configuration

Gatsby requires Node 14 to build and SSR/DSG rendering modes to work correctly. During the beta period, you need to manually set the environment variable `AWS_LAMBDA_JS_RUNTIME` to `nodejs14.x` to ensure SSR and DSG use the correct versions.

> Note - This must be done in the Netlify UI, not in the netlify.toml file. Need information on how to do that? here's [the docs for it](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/build-with-javascript/#runtime-settings).

### Confirm DSG rendering

Now that we've completed those steps, you can deploy your Gatsby 4 site on Netlify and monitor the deploy logs for evidence of DSG rendering. In my case, I did this in my Gatsby config like this:

```js
for (const node of data.allMarkdownRemark.nodes) {
  actions.createPage({
    path: `/news/${node.frontmatter.id}`,
    component: path.resolve(`./src/template/news.js`),
    ownerNodeId: node.id,
    context: {
      id: node.id,
    },
    defer: node.frontmatter.id > 3,
    // The first 3 pages will receive defer: false, the other 3 pages receive defer: true.
    // The goal is to defer the generation of the last 3 pages until the user requests for them.
  });
```

What I'm telling Gatsby is, don't generate the pages with ID's above 3 at build time. As a result, when the site is building, Gatsby will only generate pages 1,2, and 3. The rest of the pages available on the site (4,5, and 6) will be server-side rendered at request time.

![deploy log of DSG and SSR pages](/blog/gatsby-ssg-rendering.png)

As you can see from the build logs above, pages 1,2, and 3 were generated at build time with the **SSG** rendering mode, while pages 4,5, and 6 are using the **DSG** rendering mode meaning they'll be server-side on request.

### Conclusion

Ofcourse I'm super excited to see this concept of critical and deferred content generation come to life. While we are here, it is worth mentioning that there are a few caveats.

Currently you cannot use StaticImage or gatsby-transformer-sharp in SSR or DSG pages. The best workaround is to use an image CDN such as [Cloudinary](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/images-and-media/using-cloudinary-image-service/) or [imgix](https://github.com/imgix/gatsby) to host your images. This will give you faster builds and rendering too. I'm hopeful that more static site generators will take advantage of it and offer it to developers.

You can find the live demo of this project here on [Netlify](https://gatsby4-dsg-demo.netlify.app) and the project repository on [Github](https://github.com/kenny-io/Gatsby-v4-news).
