  "title": "Reactivity Wars in The Composition API",
  "description": "When working with the Vue composition API, a common question we ask ourselves is; should I use ref or reactive?. I wish the answer was a straight yes or no, but there are nuances around their behaviour that Iâ€™d like to demystify in this session. By the end, the audience will be better equipped to understand how and when to use which when building applications with the composition API. This session will include some code examples and their outputs.",
